# Patient_Journey_Mapping
-The aim of this project is to understand how patients move through the healthcare system — from the time they are admitted until the time they are discharged — and to see how we can improve their experience as well as hospital efficiency.”

 # Problem Statement
“The main problem we are trying to solve is:
How can we map the patient journey in a hospital system?
By doing this, we can highlight gaps, delays, and opportunities to improve.
This is important because patient experience and hospital operations both depend on how smoothly this journey happens.

# Dataset Contents
For this project, I used a dataset that included several key details:Patient ID, Admission ID

Consultation timings

Surgeries

Discharge timings

Gender of patients

With this information, I was able to track how patients entered the hospital, what treatment they went through, and when they were discharged.

– Data Cleaning & Tools
First, I cleaned the dataset in Microsoft Excel — removing errors, duplicates, and making sure all dates and times were in the correct format.
After that, I imported the clean data into Power BI and created dashboards to analyze and visualize the patient journey.
Finally, I designed this presentation using PowerPoint to summarize my findings.

 #  Patient Journey Mapping Dashboard

Department-wise Patient Count – This shows how many patients visited each department. We see that neurology has the highest count. This tells us which departments are busier and need more resources.

Gender Distribution – The chart shows that male and female patients are almost equal in number. This means the hospital must ensure care protocols are balanced for both genders.

Admissions vs Discharges Over Time – This compares how many patients were admitted and discharged on different days. It helps to identify peak workload days.

Length of Stay – Here we see how many days patients usually stayed in the hospital. Most stayed for 1–2 days, which means patient flow is manageable.

Average Consultation Duration by Department – This shows how quickly consultations happen. Cardiology is the fastest, while orthopedics takes longer. This gives clues about efficiency.

# KPIs –----

Maximum days stayed,

Total discharges,

Most busy department,

And advantages like tracking peak timings.

 – Forecasting Graph
This graph shows a forecast of patient inflow.
On the x-axis we have days, and on the y-axis we have the number of patients.
The trend line shows that patient inflow is not consistent — it goes up and down.

 # Key Insights (Part 1)
1. Gender distribution is perfectly balanced — 50% male and 50% female.
2. Neurology has the highest patient count at 17, followed by General Medicine and Orthopedics. Cardiology has the lowest count.
3. Average consultation time: Cardiology is the fastest at just 0.67 minutes, followed by Neurology, Pediatrics, and Orthopedics. This means cardiology is more efficient in consultations.”

# Key Insights (Part 2)
“Other insights are:
4. Admissions vs Discharges show 6 to 8 peak days where hospital workload is higher.
5. Length of stay is short, mostly 2 days or less, which is good for hospital flow.
6. The day-wise patient count shows fluctuations. This irregular inflow means hospitals need to stay flexible, but overall it is manageable.”

#  Recommendations
“Based on these insights, I recommend:

# Resource Allocation – Neurology is the busiest, so extra staff or beds should be allocated here.

# Scheduling Optimization – Since there are peak days, hospitals can add extra staff during those times.

# Patient Care Efficiency – Orthopedics should review processes to reduce consultation time and improve flow.

Future Planning – Collect more historical data to predict patient peaks more accurately.

Balanced Gender Care – Since both genders are equal, care policies should ensure fairness for both men and women.”
